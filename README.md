# Non Commercial Indoor Football Instances
 This project creates a schedule for a non-professional indoor football league's double round-robin tournament, ensuring no close game successions for teams. It utilizes ASP with Clingo and compares it to frameworks like CLP in Prolog, incorporating advanced features and heuristics to produce high-quality schedules with lower computational effort.
